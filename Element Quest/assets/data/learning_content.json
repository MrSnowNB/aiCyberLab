            "hint": "Think about the element's general behavior. Is it shiny and conductive (metal)? Dull and an insulator (nonmetal)? Or somewhere in between (metalloid)? Its position on the periodic table also gives strong clues!"

            "hint": "Look at the vertical column the element is in. Elements in the same column often react similarly. For example, Group 1 elements are all very reactive alkali metals."
